USE AT OWN RISK

be aware of EpicDices limitations like:
- 100 STEEM max wins
- cant bet "Above 5-" or "Below 96+"

be aware of STEEM limitations
auto betting on STEEM blockchain will require A LOT of RC(resource credits)
if you arent aware or sure what the status of your RC is you can check out
https://steemworld.org/@-REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-STEEM-NAME
ex:https://steemworld.org/@bitcoinjake09

RC is based off your SP(STEEM POWER)
The more SP you have locked up the more RC you have and the more things you can do on the STEEM blockchain.
